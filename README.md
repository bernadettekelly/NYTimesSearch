New York Times Search

Summary: 
This app allows users to input a start and end date (between September 18th, 1851 until present) and receive a link, snippet, and lead of New York Times articles from that chosen period. Its main purpose is to serve as a browsing tool to stumble upon what issues made the news in a particular era.

Technology used: 
The app was built using the New York Times REST API. For the frontend code, I used React, Redux, HTML, and CSS. It is responsive with paramers set for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
